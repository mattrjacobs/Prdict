This is the Prdict webapp.

There are three major components so far:

1.  Webapp - This is a simple wrapper around the datastore.  Events, users, and messages are stored and manipulated through a mostly-RESTful API.

2.  Async Processing - Just starting on this one.  Some tasks need to be computed in background.  For now, just a proof of concept for the event timeliness data on the homepage, which gets stored in memcache.

3.  UI - For now, just the chat page.  I'm using the GAE channel API to pass chat messages around.  I'm using jQuery to display a reasonable chat UI.
